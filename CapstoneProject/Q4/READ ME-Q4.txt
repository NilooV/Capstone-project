Hypothesis 1: Standalone Insurance Policy
Null Hypothesis (H0): No difference in death rates between countries with and without a stand-alone policy for mental health.
Files Used:
stand-alone-policy-or-plan-for-mental-health.csv
death-rates-from-mental-and-substance-disorders-by-age-who.csv
Methods
Descriptive Analysis: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of death rates for both groups.
T-Test: Determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups.
Bootstrapping: Estimate sampling distribution and confidence intervals.
Hypothesis 2: Number of Psychiatrists
Null Hypothesis (H0): No correlation between death rates and the number of psychiatrists working in the mental health sector.
